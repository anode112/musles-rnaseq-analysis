# Multi-Omics Bioinformatics Analysis of Muscle

## Project Overview
Bioinformatics workflow for analyzing NGS data from muscle tissue samples. The aim is to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms in muscle physiology or pathology by jointly analyzing gene expression (RNA-Seq) and epigenetic landscapes (DNA methylation).
## Experiment description
Biopsy from strength untrained and trained legs muscles. RNA-seq and methylation sequencing were performed on these samples.
